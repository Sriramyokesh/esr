            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p align="justify">As a kid not too far from an international port, my initial fancy was around the field of mechanics and large-scale automobiles. I spent time learning and modeling such systems. For instance, my hydraulic lift prototype in school won acclaim in a science-exposition. The benefits associated with that domain in the transformation of human work were innumerable. I knew about programming back then, but my viewpoint was limited to thinking of it as being similar to mechanical automations - that is, it also helps automate what humans do (just do and not think).</p>
            <p>Later, I was introduced to machine learning, where machines were taught to observe, think, try, re-think, and then do. This broke all limits I thought I had set for machines in facilitating human living. In order to utilize the tremendous space for innovation this concept presents, my focus gravitated towards the world of computers. I started believing in the power of computer science and wanted to set my career in its direction.</p>
            <p>I did my Bachelors' in Computer Science at SASTRA University, India and graduated with an honors in 2019. I then worked at Informatica for three years as an Research & Development Engineer before joining UIUC for Masters during Fall 2022.</p>
            <p>I'm always interested in <a href = "https://www.hackerrank.com/certificates/a2d66f82cebb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Problem Solving</a> and you can find me thinking about strange algorithms for stranger problems.</p>
            <p>I'm generally quite, love cricket and am passionate about the future of the world with the disruption coming through Aritifical Intelligence that humans develop.</p>

            <h5>Software Engineering Tasks using Large Language Models (LLM)</h5>
              <p>This is expected to start by or after the summer of 2023.</p>
            <h5>Application of Topic Mining to Browser Bookmarks</h5>
              <p>Develop an extension for Chrome browser (later to other browsers also) that enables intelligent bookmarking.<br/>
              Implement topic modeling to automatically categorize bookmarks into meaningful divisions to ease browsing experience (Available from May 2023).</p>
            </p>
            <h5>Analytics Service for Online Learning Platform</h5>
              <p>This was an Indian Institue of Technology - Bombay (IIT-B) Internship Project under the Ministry of Education, Govt. of India.<br/>
              Enhanced online student learning experience by creating an 'Analytics' section for <a href = "https://sunbird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunbird</a> platform to present dashboard-based inferences to course takers and organizers.<br/>
              Used D3.js, Node.js, Cassandra, HTML, CSS, Google Charts.<br/>
              Learned Practical Test Driven Development (TDD) model and stakeholder communication.</p> 
              <h5>Bin-packing Heuristic for Cloud Data Centers(NP-Hard Problem)</h5>
              <p>This was a project under the guidance Dr. Saikishor Jangiti on cloud optimization heuristics.<br/>
                Proposed and implemented heuristics for efficient placement of virtual machines in cloud data centers (CDCs) to minimize wastage of resources and cut operational cost.<br/>
                Deployed with savings optimized by 22%-36% in heterogenous, homogenous and fog cyber physical systems.</p>
            <h5>Review Classification for e-Commerce Websites</h5>
              <p>This was an academic project for the Natural Language Processing course under Prof. Pradeepa at SASTRA.<br/>
                Used Hadoop map reduce for key word extraction from user reviews.<br/>
                Bagged extracted words to classify those reviews in e-Commerce websites using normal classifcation algorithmic models.</p>
            <h5>Preventing DDoS Attacks in Mobile AdHoc Networks (MANETs)</h5>
              <p>3PAT was initially proposed to detect black holes in infrastructure-less networks or Mobile AdHoc Networks (MANETs).<br/>
                A collection of black holes acting in tandem create a worm hole.<br/>
                An extension of 3PAT with logical assumptions resulted in a competitive algorithm for the detection of worm hole tunnels in wireless sensor networks.<br>
            </p>
            <h5>Billing Software for a local retailer</h5>
              <p>This project was completed with help from my batchmate Sushmanth Reddy to aid a retail store in managing their growing demands/capacity of goods.<br/>
                Designed and developed a billing software using C++ for a retail store in Thanjavur, India.<br/>
                Included an automated tax calculator/advisor and customized options according to stakeholder needs.</p>
            <h5>My First Website - Book Trader Online</h5> 
              <p>This was my first website I built in 2015 that can be used for trading books.<br/>
              Allows personalized logins, reset passwords, uploading of books and downloading of books.<br/>
            Also does reasonable recommendations based on user interests (not intelligent recommendations, but just based on manual preferences).<br>
            Used 5 normalized databases Interests, Users, Books, Tracking, Trade with MySQL. <br/>
          A limitation was the presence of security issues with reset password emails and cookies.</p>
